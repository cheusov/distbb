=head1 NAME

distbb - distributed bulk build tool for I<pkgsrc>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<distbb> I<-h>

B<distbb> I<-V>

B<distbb> I<[options]>

=head1 FEATURES

B<distbb> has the following features:

=over 6

=item

packages may be built in isolated environment, e.g., chroots or virtual machines.

=item

more than one package may be built in parallel.

=item

arbitrary list of packages may be built (see B<-p> and B<-f> options).

=item

good full-featured reports.

=item

support for unprivileged bulk builds.

=item

flexibility and extensibility, user-defined stages and bmake targets.

=item

parallelism is provided by paexec(1).

=item

written in shell, awk and other command-line tools.

=item

flexibility, a lot of things can be customized via config file.

=item

modularity, bulk build consists of the following stages:

=over 2

=item

init: preparations

=item

build: packages build

=item

gen_report_data: generation of bulk build results

=item

summary: update pkg_summary(5)

=item

checks: post build checks and statistics

=item

gen_report: generation of bulk build report data

=item

update_best: compare current bulk build with previous one, e.g., 2024Q2 vs. HEAD

=item

checksum: generation of SHA512.bz2

=item

upload_logs: upload logs to remote host

=item

upload_pkgs: upload packages to remote host, NO_BIN_ON_CDROM
and NO_BIN_ON_FTP are taken into account

=item

send_report: send bulk build report via email

=back

=item

resistance to virtual machine failure, in parallel mode if client host
(virtual machine) fails for some reason, distbb continues to work and rebuild
failed package. After reboot, failed virtual machine can be used again,
this is automated process.

=item

enriched PKGPATH can be used for building, e.g.,

    $ ~/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb -p 'sysutils/mc:PKG_OPTIONS.mc=-ncurses~-nls~slang~-mc-charset,PKGNAME=mc-light-4.8.28nb4'
    $ ~/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb -p 'sysutils/mc:PKG_OPTIONS.mc=-x11,PKGNAME=mc-nox11-4.8.28nb4'
    $ ~/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb -p 'sysutils/mc'
    $ ~/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb -p 'devel/py-flit_core:PYTHON_VERSION_REQD=311'
    $ ~/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb -p 'textproc/dictem:EMACS_TYPE=26'

Enriching here means additional building options in the following form
category/package[:var1=value1[,var2=value2[,...]]]

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 6

=item B<-h>

Display this help.

=item B<-V>

Display version of B<distbb>.

=item B<-C> I<config_file>

Specify the configuration file. The default is I<@sysconfdir@/distbb.conf>.

=item B<-p> I<packages>

Specify a list of packages (PKGPATHs) to build. By default all pkgsrc packages are built.
This option implies B<-x> I<summary> B<-x> I<checksum> B<-x> I<upload_pkgs>.

=item B<-f> I<file>

Specify a filename with packages (PKGPATHs) to build, one line per package.
By default all pkgsrc packages are built. Single dash "-" means stdin.
This option implies "B<-x> I<summary>", "B<-x> I<checksum>", and "B<-x> I<upload_pkgs>".

=item B<-i>

Build all installed packages.

=item B<-I> I<pkgdb>

The same as -i but installed packages are obtained from I<pkgdb>.

=item B<-a>

Build packages specified by B<-f> or B<-p> and add new summaries to I<pkg_summary(5)>.

=item B<-D>

Show difference with previous bulk build.

=item B<-B> I<buildid>

Specify the build id which is used as a name of directory for working files
under report directory. By default build id is generated as YYYYMMDD.HHMM
of the current time.

=item B<-r>

If your bulk build failed for some reason (host system reboot, for
example), you can continue your bulk build from the point it stopped
at.

=item B<-k>

Skip updating pkg_src_summary.

=item B<-K>

Skip updating pkg_summary.

=item B<-s>

Exit status is 0, if all requested packages were built successfully, or 5 otherwise.

=item B<-l> I<label>

Specify the label for bulk build. Unless -B option is applied
bulk build files will be stored in $REPORTS_DIR/$BUILD_ID-<label> directory.

=item B<-x> I<stage>

Disable the specified stage from BUILD_STAGES.
Multiple B<-x> are allowed.
"B<-x> I<upload>" is equivalent to
"B<-x> I<upload_logs> B<-x> I<upload_pkgs>".

=item B<-X> I<stage>

Enable the specified stage.

=item B<-m> <mode>

Specify mode of dependency graph generation.
0 - use package from pkgsrc tree (the default)
1 - use latest available binary if it satisfies
DEPENDS, BUILD_DEPENDS or TOOL_DEPENDS.

=head1 CONFIG FILES

@sysconfdir@/distbb.conf

=head1 EXIT STATUS
