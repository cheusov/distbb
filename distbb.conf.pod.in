=head1 NAME

distbb.conf - distributed bulk build tool for I<pkgsrc>

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<distbb.conf> is a configuration file for B<distbb> which is actually a shell script.
It is loaded both on host and slaves. All exported variables are passed to B<bmake>.
This means that one can set (and export!) such variables as MAKE_JOBS, READLINE_DEFAULT,
PKG_DEFAULT_OPTIONS etc. directly in this configuration file.

=head1 MAIN CONFIGURATION VARIABLES

=over 6

=item

I<PKGSRCDIR> -- root directory for pkgsrc. The default is I</usr/pkgsrc>.
This variable is automatically exported.
Therefore, it makes sense to not set PKGSRCDIR in B<mk.conf>.

=item

I<PKGSRCVER> -- pkgsrc version. The default is I<unknown>.

=item

I<PKGSRC_PREFIX> -- pkgsrc prefix. The default is I</usr/pkg>.

=item

I<PACKAGES> -- directory with binary packages. The default is I<$PKGSRCDIR/packages>.
This variable is automatically exported.
Therefore, it makes sense to remove PACKAGES from B<mk.conf>.

=item

I<DISTDIR> -- distdir directory. By default it is unset.
If set, it is automatically exported.
In this case, it makes sense to remove DISTDIR from B<mk.conf>.
