 - stage_cksum

 - pkg_summary.txt consisting of only built packages,
   no "packages in pkg_summary.txt" message in report.html


ideas/thoughts/todo/problems

 - PKG_SUFX is deprecated, use PKG_COMPRESS

 - Analyse REQUIRES and PROVIDES while running bulk builds

 - META/packages_status.txt

 - links to package's configure.log(s) from PKGNAME/stage_*.html

 - separate DEPENDS and BUILD_DEPENDS (versions should be analysed)

 - build time of binary packages?
   problem:
     package_A depends on package_B
     bin_package_A.tgz was built earlier than bin_package_B.tgz file
     ===> package_A is NOT rebuilt in this case, that is
        build time of binary packages is currently not checked

 - rebuilding packages changed in CVS (without version changes!)

 - distbb.1

 - I think distbb can be adapted for FreeBSD/OpenBSD Ports
   and other packaging systems

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
