  - 1) Package A depends on {B,C}:../../some/where/C
    2) B is already built
    1) + 2) ==> B is not installed by "make depends"

  - Why this happends? ~/bulk-logs/20100403.0159
  started: graphics/py-clutter:PYTHON_VERSION_REQD=25 on root@pkgsrc-63

 - Partial bulk build for audio_flac123 fails
   file:///home/cheusov/bulk-logs/20100314.1851/audio_flac123_flac123-0.0.11/stage_dbb_depends.html
   DEPENDS
      ERROR: [depends.mk] A package matching ``libao-[a-z]*-[0-9]*'' should
      ERROR:     be installed, but one cannot be found.  Perhaps there is a
      ERROR:     stale work directory for ../../audio/libao-oss?

 - pkg_summary.txt consisting of only built packages,
   no "packages in pkg_summary.txt" message in report.html

 - distbb_diff: ignore :blablabla=1 part while comparing.
   .best_bb.old vs. 20100221.1315

 - build graph is build using {THIS,xxx}:../../yyy/zzz,
   but 'make depends' {xxx,THIS}:../../TH/IS
   This is a BIG problem

 - pkg_src_summary -A may build an incomplete summary in case
   {x,y}:../z/a deps.
   file:///home/cheusov/bulk-logs/20100109.0059/META/report.html
   See devel/p5-ExtUtils-ParseXS and
   pkg_src_summary:filter_needed_deps function.

 - pkg_cmp_summary should compare DEPENDS and BUILD_DEPENDS and print !
   if the y different  

 - Analyse REQUIRES and PROVIDES while running bulk builds

 - dbb_package -> "install"+"package" or just "package" depending
   on PKG_DESTDIR_SUPPORT

 - link from stage_*.html to META/report.html

 - META/packages_status.txt

 - stage_cksum

 - links to package's configure.log(s) from PKGNAME/stage_*.html

 - separate DEPENDS and BUILD_DEPENDS (versions should be analysed)

 - modification time of binary packages?
   problem:
     package_A depends on package_B
     bin_package_A.tgz file is older than bin_package_B.tgz file
     ===> package_A is NOT rebuilt in this case, that is
        modification time of binary packages is currently not checked

 - rebuilding packages changed in CVS (without version changes!)

 - distbb.1

 - I think distbb can be adapted for FreeBSD/OpenBSD Ports
   and other packaging systems

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
