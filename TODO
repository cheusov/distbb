Plan0)

 - distbb -i -- rebuild installed packages and generate summary

 - create final pkg_summary.txt in bulk-buld/META and then copy it

 - pkg_info -N

 - analyse common files and CONFLICTS, red "sanity checks"?

 - pkg_lint_summary -abcde --> linting summary.

 - use shlock for protectiion against running several instances of distbb

 - distbb.1

 - META/packages_status.txt

 - Automatically create r/o chroot under NetBSD, replacement for pkg_comp.

Plan1)

 - Analyse REQUIRES and PROVIDES while running bulk builds?

 - links to package's configure.log(s) from PKGNAME/stage_*.html?

 - separate DEPENDS and BUILD_DEPENDS (versions should be analysed)?

 - build time of binary packages?
   problem:
     package_A depends on package_B
     bin_package_A.tgz was built earlier than bin_package_B.tgz file
     ===> package_A is NOT rebuilt in this case, that is
        build time of binary packages is currently not checked

 - rebuilding packages changed in CVS (without version changes)?

Plan +inf)

 - I think distbb can be adapted for FreeBSD/OpenBSD Ports
   and other packaging systems

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
