 - flushed META/progress.txt
    package1.txt date/time succeeded on host1
    package2.txt date/time failed on host2
    package3.txt date/time failed on host3
    ...
 - (?) put packages to paexec one-by-one and make stage_build rerunable
   (distbb -k already works correctly)
 - distbb.1
 - distbb.mk + distbb.local.mk
 - MAX_FAILURES_CNT=6
 - bad packages

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
