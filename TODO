 - flushed META/progress.txt
    package1.txt date/time succeeded on host1
    package2.txt date/time failed on host2
    package3.txt date/time failed on host3
    ...
 - distributed PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD (part of pkg_summary-utils)
 - (?) put packages to paexec one-by-one and make stage_build rerunable
   (distbb -k already works correctly)
 - distbb.1

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
