 - sort_uniq META/packages_{built,failed}.txt
   When libexec/distbb/stage_build is run manually
   duplicates may appear.

 - simplify distbb.conf. distbb is very customizable, but
   distbb.conf becomes very large.

 - report.html links to difference with previous bulk build results.
    - pkgname1 pkgname2 maintainer
    + pkgpath2 pkgname2

 - distbb -C config-file.conf,
   mandatory variable DISTBB_LOCAL_MK=@sysconfdir@/distbb.local.mk,
   stage_* scripts should use config files stored (or linked) in META/

 - pbulk builds pyNN-xxx and apNN-xxx packages, distbb doesn't.
   This is the only regression I see in comparison to pbulk.

 - modification time of binary packages?
 - problem:
   package_A depends on package_B
   bin_package_A.tgz file is older (modification time)
   than bin_package_B.tgz file
   ===> package_A is NOT rebuilt in this case, that is
        modification time of binary packages are currently not checked
 - distbb.1
 - my-show-vars -> share/distbb/distbb.mk
 - I think distbb can be adapted for FreeBSD/OpenBSD Ports
   and other packaging systems

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
