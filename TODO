 - PKG_CMP_SUMMARY_CMD - 'pkg_cmp_summary -c' for rebuilding packages
   changed in CVS

 - silent dbb_init

 - upload_pkgs aware of NO_BIN/NO_CDROM

 - stage_cksum

 - 'distbb -c' for continuing faild bulk build

 - BUILD_STAGES='...upload_logs upload_pkgs report' vs.
   BUILD_STAGES='...upload_logs report upload_pkgs'
   for sending report before uploading packages

 - links to package's configure.log(s) from PKGNAME/stage_*.html

 - simplify distbb.conf. distbb is very customizable, but
   distbb.conf becomes very large.

 - separate DEPENDS from BUILD_DEPENDS (versions should be analysed)

 - modification time of binary packages?
   problem:
     package_A depends on package_B
     bin_package_A.tgz file is older than bin_package_B.tgz file
     ===> package_A is NOT rebuilt in this case, that is
        modification time of binary packages is currently not checked

 - distbb.1, feature list in README

 - I think distbb can be adapted for FreeBSD/OpenBSD Ports
   and other packaging systems

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
