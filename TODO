 - BUILD_STAGES='build post_build gen_report update_best upload_logs upload_pkgs report'

 - links to package's configure.log(s) from PKGNAME/stage_*.html

 - simplify distbb.conf. distbb is very customizable, but
   distbb.conf becomes very large.

 - separate DEPENDS from BUILD_DEPENDS (versions should be analysed)

 - modification time of binary packages?
   problem:
     package_A depends on package_B
     bin_package_A.tgz file is older (modification time)
     than bin_package_B.tgz file
     ===> package_A is NOT rebuilt in this case, that is
        modification time of binary packages are currently not checked

 - distbb.1

 - I think distbb can be adapted for FreeBSD/OpenBSD Ports
   and other packaging systems

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
