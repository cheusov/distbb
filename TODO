 - link from stage_xxx.html to report.html

 - stage_cksum

 - links to package's configure.log(s) from PKGNAME/stage_*.html

 - separate DEPENDS from BUILD_DEPENDS (versions should be analysed)

 - modification time of binary packages?
   problem:
     package_A depends on package_B
     bin_package_A.tgz file is older than bin_package_B.tgz file
     ===> package_A is NOT rebuilt in this case, that is
        modification time of binary packages is currently not checked

 - rebuilding packages changed in CVS (without version changes!)

 - distbb.1

 - I think distbb can be adapted for FreeBSD/OpenBSD Ports
   and other packaging systems

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
