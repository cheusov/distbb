 - links to package's src_summary from PKGNAME/stage_*.html

 - links to package's configure.log(s) from PKGNAME/stage_*.html

 - links to package's variables (CFLAGS, MAKE_FLAGS etc.) from
   PKGNAME/stage_*.html

 - simplify distbb.conf. distbb is very customizable, but
   distbb.conf becomes very large.

 - distbb -C config-file.conf,
   mandatory variable DISTBB_LOCAL_MK=@sysconfdir@/distbb.local.mk,
   stage_* scripts should use config files stored (or linked) in META/

 - modification time of binary packages?
   problem:
     package_A depends on package_B
     bin_package_A.tgz file is older (modification time)
     than bin_package_B.tgz file
     ===> package_A is NOT rebuilt in this case, that is
        modification time of binary packages are currently not checked

 - distbb.1

 - my-show-vars -> share/distbb/distbb.mk

 - I think distbb can be adapted for FreeBSD/OpenBSD Ports
   and other packaging systems

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
