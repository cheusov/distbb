 - modification time of binary packages?
 - problem:
   package_A depends on package_B
   bin_package_A.tgz is older than bin_package_B.tgz
   ===> package_A is NOT rebuilt in this case, that is
        a modification time of binary packages are currently not checked
 - distbb -C config-file.conf,
   mandatory variable DISTBB_LOCAL_MK=@sysconfdir@/distbb.local.mk
 - todo:
     - add CVS_FINGERPRINT to pkg_src_summary
     - pkg_cmp_summary should use it and should produce "!="
      if versions are the same and CVS_FINGERPRINTs are not.
 - flushed META/progress.txt
   package1.txt date/time succeeded on host1
   package2.txt date/time failed on host2
   package3.txt date/time failed on host3
   ...
 - (?) put packages to paexec one-by-one and make stage_build rerunable
 - distbb.1
 - my-show-vars -> share/distbb/distbb.mk
 - I think distbb can be adapted for FreeBSD/OpenBSD Ports.

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
