ideas/todo

 - flushed META/progress.txt
    package1.txt date/time succeeded on host1
    package2.txt date/time failed on host2
    package3.txt date/time failed on host3
    ...
 - distributed PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD (part of pkg_summary-utils)
 - progress message 'FAILED|succeeded on ***HOST***'
   just like 'started on ***HOST***'
 - [optional] add email of person who run bulk build to report.html
 - add distbb version to report.html
 - (?) put packages to paexec one-by-one and make stage_build rerunable
   (distbb -k already works correctly)
 - distbb.1

 - Any ideas? Let me know. vle@gmx.net
