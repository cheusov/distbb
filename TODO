Plan0)

 - Ensure that dependencies activated using bl3 PROVIDEs something
   REQUIRED by the package.

 - Explicitely set SU_CMD to something noisy.

 - Analyser:
   - unnecessary CONFLICTS
   - possibility of installation each package in the repository
   - config.log may help to recognize bad DEPENDS and BUILD_DEPENDS
   - recognize previous bulk build and packages failed at that time
     which succeeded in new bulk build. Compare {BUILD_,}DEPENDS then

 - Update README!!!

 - -x and -X: check for stage correctness

 - pkg_info -N

 - use shlock for protection against running several instances of distbb

 - distbb.1

 - META/packages_status.txt

 - Automatically create r/o chroot under NetBSD, replacement for pkg_comp.

Plan1)

 - links to package's configure.log(s) from PKGNAME/stage_*.html?

 - rebuilding packages changed in CVS (without version changes)?

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
