Plan0)

 - Ensure that dependencies activated using bl3 PROVIDEs something
   REQUIRED by the package.

 - Analyse CONFLICTs (pkg_conflicts) for the whole repository.
 - Analyse PLIST entries vs. CONFLICTS.
 - Analyse ability of the package to be installed (PLIST, CONFLICTS).
 - Analyse symbols of executables and libraries

 - Update README!!!

 - -x and -X: check for stage correctness

 - Add PLIST to pkg_summary.txt

 - pkg_info -N

 - Red "sanity checks" in report.html
   *) analyse common files and CONFLICTS
   *) analyse REQUIRES and PROVIDES (pkg_lint_summary -l)

 - use shlock for protection against running several instances of distbb

 - distbb.1

 - META/packages_status.txt

 - Automatically create r/o chroot under NetBSD, replacement for pkg_comp.

Plan1)

 - links to package's configure.log(s) from PKGNAME/stage_*.html?

 - separate DEPENDS and BUILD_DEPENDS (versions should be analysed)?

 - rebuilding packages changed in CVS (without version changes)?

ANY IDEAS? LET ME KNOW. VLE@GMX.NET
