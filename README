distbb - distributed bulk builds framework for pkgsrc (www.pkgsrc.org)

Requirements (in tutorial form):
1) bootstrap your working pkgsrc (to /usr/pkg, for example)
   - edit /usr/pkg/etc/mk.conf

     Sample:
       ...
       _ACCEPTABLE=                    yes
       PKG_DEVELOPER=                  yes
       ALLOW_VULNERABLE_PACKAGES=      yes

       X11_TYPE=                       modular
       PKG_SUFX=                      .tbz
   - create bootstrap.tar.gz

2) bootstrap pkgsrc for distbb (to /usr/pkg_distbb, for example)
   - install wip/distbb in it
   - install other software you may need
   - edit /usr/pkg_distbb/etc/distbb.conf configuration file

For "distributed" builds:

3d) On master host:
    make /usr/pkg_distbb and /usr/pkgsrc directories NFS mountable
    for all your slave hosts.

4d) On all slave hosts:
    mount -t nfs -o ro master:/usr/pkg_distbb /usr/pkg_distbb
    mount -t nfs -o rw master:/usr/pkgsrc     /usr/pkgsrc

    /usr/pkg (and PKGDBDIR) needs to be per slave (will be deleted)

5d) /usr/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb -h
    /usr/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb                 # for full bulk build
    /usr/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb -f packages.txt # for partial bulk build

  NOTE:
    - in "distributed" mode master's /usr/pkg is NOT changed.
      Neither pkg_add not pkg_delete is called on master's host.
      /usr/pkgsrc/packages/pkg_summary.txt and
      /usr/pkgsrc/pkg_src_summary.txt are changed/created/updated.
    - you should not be root on master host.

For single-node bulk build:

3s) /usr/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb -h
    /usr/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb                 # for full bulk build
    /usr/pkg_distbb/bin/distbb -f packages.txt # for partial bulk build

  Note that /usr/pkg (and PKGDBDIR) will be created.
