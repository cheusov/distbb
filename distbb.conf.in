NOTES=''

# some packages fail to build because they are a part of pkgsrc
# bootstrap.  if you want to build them try to uncomment lines in
# SPECIAL_PACKAGES variables
#
# you may also want to use different building options
# to build some packages, e.g. to use gcc-3.4 for building audio/festival,
# (Under Linux Debian/etch and DragonFlyBSD gcc-3.4 is a part
# of "base" system), see below.
# NOTE: There are no quotes around string containing spaces
#       (this is not shell ;-) )
# NOTE: An empty string after EACH package section is mandatory
# NOTE: Do not forget that you can define your own Makefile targets
#       in distbb.local.mk. this new target can run, for example,
#       pkg_add -u
