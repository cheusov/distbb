Version 0.11.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 15 May 2008 18:59:18 +0300

  Both .html and .txt report include a number failed dependancies for
  each indirectly failed package. This number was limited by hardcoded
  constant, now it is regulated by variable MAX_FAILED_DEPS_CNT Add it
  to your distbb.conf.

  stage_gen_report: fix for Debian dash - its ` and $( work
  differently :-(

  distbb uses TARGETS variables that contains a list of targets to run
  in order to build, install and create a binary package. TARGETS
  variable can easily be changed by user and this makes distbb very
  flexible - user may change build order or even define his own
  build/packaging procedure. As of this version user can define
  his/her own make rules without changing mk.conf and without
  recreating bootstrap tarball - by changing
  /usr/pkg_distbb/etc/distbb.local.mk file, second configuration file
  of distbb. distbb also defines two its own special targets which you
  can use: dbb_canbebuilt and dbb_excluded.  Read comments in
  /usr/pkg_distbb/share/distbb/distbb.mk about them.  Note that
  etc/distbb/local.mk MUST exist, copy it from
  share/examples/distbb/distbb.local.mk to etc/distbb.local.mk
  and edit for preferences.

Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov

  At startup, PREFIX and PKGDBDIR directories are deleted and
  bootstrap is unpacked (on all $SLAVES when MASTER_MODE=yes).
  NOTE: if you are upgrading from previous versions of distbb,
  recheck your EXTRACT_BOOTSTRAP_CMD (tar -C / is needed).

  distbb.conf: more examples for alternative/distributed
  PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD. If you'll use distributed one,
  make sure PATH variable contains /usr/pkg_distbb/bin directory.

Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri,  9 May 2008 13:02:30 +0300

  Instead of red counts the "Breaks" column now contains the link to
  the actual list of indirectly failed packages.

  stage_gen_report: hardcoded string "Responsible person" is not printed

  distbb.conf: another variant for PKG_UPDATE_SUMMARY_CMD

  Additions and more details in README

  BUILD_START renamed to BUILD_ID

Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  4 May 2008 20:50:43 +0300

  Sometimes building packages stops because some of them require an
  interaction with user. BATCH=yes doesn't help.  In order to prevent
  this, bmake is run with < /dev/null. As a result, such a bad
  packages can not break/stop bulk builds anymore.

  distbb version is included to the report.

  An information about the person that runs a bulk build, is
  optionally included to the report.

  LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD variable is introduced.  It defaults to
  'pkg_list_all_pkgs'.  If set, the specified command is run to get
  list of packages to be built.
  You need to upgrade your distbb.conf
     Examples:
        LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD='@@bindir@@/pkg_list_all_pkgs'
        #LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD='( @@bindir@@/pkg_list_all_pkgs
                              cat my_extra_wip_packages.txt )'

  added: distbb --version|-V options

  "on <SLAVEHOST>" is appended to 'succeeded' and 'FAILED' log
  messages. That is now it is seen on which host a particular package
  succeeded or failed.

  distbb.conf.in:
  # The following is for pkg_summary-tools > 0.5.0
  #PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD='@@bindir@@/pkg_update_src_summary -f "PKGNAME PKGPATH DEPENDS BUILD_DEPENDS"'

Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 17 Apr 2008 12:30:58 +0300

  stage_init.in: completely reimplemented. An algorithm become easier
  and cleaner. FIXED: incorrect calculating "build_previously" count,
  and therefore "total_packages" too. The code also become cleaner.

  FIX: build_init.in now doesn't depend on fields order in
  pkg_src_summary (doesn't reply on that PKGPATH is before
  [BUILD_]DEPENDS). This may cause an inifinite loop because of
  oncorrect (cyclic) dependancies in META/tmp/trans_closure.tmp

  distbb.conf.in:
    minor fix: pkg_src_update_summary -> pkg_update_src_summary

  Exporting LC_ALL=C and other important initializations have been
  moved from distbb.in to common.in. Now every significant
  initialization is made in PREFIX/libexec/distbb/stage_*, i.e. these
  scripts become more all-sufficient.
