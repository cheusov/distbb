Version 0.14.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 18 Jun 2008 22:14:56 +0300

  FIXED: sometimes packages are built in a wrong order.

  FIXED: there were two examples for PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD
  in the sample distbb.conf:
  'pkg_update_src_summary' and 'pkg_src_summary'. But the latter
  just didn't work because these two commands have imcomppatible usage.
  Now this is fixed but changes are incompatible with old distbb.conf.
  Update it according to the new sample for distbb.conf.
  Also set I_AM_READY variable to 1.
  Side effect: 'pkg_src_summary -A' can now be used for generating summary.
  This will build pkg_src_summary only for requested packages (distbb -f)
  and their dependancies, not for entire pkgsrc
  tree (pkg_update_src_summary).
  Both Hubert's bulk build and pbulk work this way. Now distbb too.

  FIX: EXTRA_DEPS now can contain more than one package and is handled
  correctly. Copy EXTRA_DEPS_CMD from the sample to your distbb.conf

  The following files are sorted alphabetically:
     CATEGORY/PACKAGE/failed_packages.txt
     CATEGORY/PACKAGE/failed_because.txt
     META/packages_built_prev.txt
     META/packages_failed_deps.txt
  In case of LOTS of failures this make searching in these files much easier.

  Latest paexec, runawk and pkg_summary-utils are needed.

  report.html and all others conforms to HTML 4.01 Strict specification.
  Thanks to validator.w3.org
  UTF-8 charset is also used (See NOTES and RESPONSIBLE variables)

  "build_end" date/time are moved from stage_gen_report to stage_build.

  Lots of comments and suggestions in the sample for distbb.conf

  Other minor fixes, improvements and code clean-ups.

Version 0.13.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 12 Jun 2008 23:40:46 +0300

  ADDED: mega-feature/new variable SPECIAL_PACKAGES

     Example and notes from distbb.conf:
     ...
     # some packages fail to build because they are a part of pkgsrc
     # bootstrap.  if you want to build them try to uncomment lines in
     # SPECIAL_PACKAGES variables
     #
     # you may also want to use different building options
     # to build some packages, e.g. to use gcc-3.4 for building audio/festival,
     # under Linux Debian/etch or DragonFlyBSD where it is a part
     # of "base" system, see lines in SPECIAL_PACKAGES.
     # NOTE: There are no quotes around string containing spaces
     #       (this is not shell ;-) )
     # NOTE: An empty string after EACH package section is mandatory
     # NOTE: Do not forget that you can define your own Makefile targets
     #       in distbb.local.mk. this new target can run, for example,
     #       pkg_add -u

     SPECIAL_PACKAGES="\
     #PKGPATH=pkgtools/digest
     #TARGETS=depends fetch checksum configure build package
     #EXTRA_OPTS=BATCH=yes PKG_VERBOSE=1 USE_DESTDIR=full CHECK_SHLIBS=no
     #
     #PKGPATH=pkgtools/bootstrap-mk-files

     #
     "

  distbb.conf: 'extract' and 'patch' targets are in TARGETS now.

  distbb.conf: fix in comment: package-deinstall -> deinstall

Version 0.12.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  8 Jun 2008 02:49:08 +0300

  Two new variables (for distbb.conf) are introduced:
    - STDIN_FROM_DEV_NULL:
      Some broken packages need an interaction with user even if BATCH
      variable is set to YES. This may "hang" a bulk build. If you
      don't want this, set the following variable to "1", otherwise
      leave it unset.
    - LOG_SIZE_LIMIT:
      If STDIN_FROM_DEV_NULL=1, some packages may produce infinite
      garbage to stdout and in turn may waste ALL your free disk
      space. To prevent this, set the following limit. Leave it unset
      for no limit.

  fix:
     If there is nothing to be built stage_build may fail under Linux,
     Solaris, HP-UX, Interix and probably many others. This is because
     Free/NetBSD xargs works differently - in case of no input it just
     do NOT call program (xargs's argument) at all. Others do.

   stage_*.txt files are not uploaded anymore.
   Only html versions are uploaded.

   README: distbb is NOT fork of pbulk in any way! ;-)
   It was written from scratch.

Version 0.11.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 15 May 2008 18:59:18 +0300

  Both .html and .txt report include a number failed dependancies for
  each indirectly failed package. This number was limited by hardcoded
  constant, now it is regulated by variable MAX_FAILED_DEPS_CNT Add it
  to your distbb.conf.

  stage_gen_report: fix for Debian dash - its ` and $( work
  differently :-(

  distbb uses TARGETS variables that contains a list of targets to run
  in order to build, install and create a binary package. TARGETS
  variable can easily be changed by user and this makes distbb very
  flexible - user may change build order or even define his own
  build/packaging procedure. As of this version user can define
  his/her own make rules without changing mk.conf and without
  recreating bootstrap tarball - by changing
  /usr/pkg_distbb/etc/distbb.local.mk file, second configuration file
  of distbb. distbb also defines two its own special targets which you
  can use: dbb_canbebuilt and dbb_excluded.  Read comments in
  /usr/pkg_distbb/share/distbb/distbb.mk about them.  Note that
  etc/distbb/local.mk MUST exist, copy it from
  share/examples/distbb/distbb.local.mk to etc/distbb.local.mk
  and edit for preferences.

Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov

  At startup, PREFIX and PKGDBDIR directories are deleted and
  bootstrap is unpacked (on all $SLAVES when MASTER_MODE=yes).
  NOTE: if you are upgrading from previous versions of distbb,
  recheck your EXTRACT_BOOTSTRAP_CMD (tar -C / is needed).

  distbb.conf: more examples for alternative/distributed
  PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD. If you'll use distributed one,
  make sure PATH variable contains /usr/pkg_distbb/bin directory.

Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri,  9 May 2008 13:02:30 +0300

  Instead of red counts the "Breaks" column now contains the link to
  the actual list of indirectly failed packages.

  stage_gen_report: hardcoded string "Responsible person" is not printed

  distbb.conf: another variant for PKG_UPDATE_SUMMARY_CMD

  Additions and more details in README

  BUILD_START renamed to BUILD_ID

Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  4 May 2008 20:50:43 +0300

  Sometimes building packages stops because some of them require an
  interaction with user. BATCH=yes doesn't help.  In order to prevent
  this, bmake is run with < /dev/null. As a result, such a bad
  packages can not break/stop bulk builds anymore.

  distbb version is included to the report.

  An information about the person that runs a bulk build, is
  optionally included to the report.

  LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD variable is introduced.  It defaults to
  'pkg_list_all_pkgs'.  If set, the specified command is run to get
  list of packages to be built.
  You need to upgrade your distbb.conf
     Examples:
        LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD='@@bindir@@/pkg_list_all_pkgs'
        #LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD='( @@bindir@@/pkg_list_all_pkgs
                              cat my_extra_wip_packages.txt )'

  added: distbb --version|-V options

  "on <SLAVEHOST>" is appended to 'succeeded' and 'FAILED' log
  messages. That is now it is seen on which host a particular package
  succeeded or failed.

  distbb.conf.in:
  # The following is for pkg_summary-tools > 0.5.0
  #PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD='@@bindir@@/pkg_update_src_summary -f "PKGNAME PKGPATH DEPENDS BUILD_DEPENDS"'

Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 17 Apr 2008 12:30:58 +0300

  stage_init.in: completely reimplemented. An algorithm become easier
  and cleaner. FIXED: incorrect calculating "build_previously" count,
  and therefore "total_packages" too. The code also become cleaner.

  FIX: build_init.in now doesn't depend on fields order in
  pkg_src_summary (doesn't reply on that PKGPATH is before
  [BUILD_]DEPENDS). This may cause an inifinite loop because of
  oncorrect (cyclic) dependancies in META/tmp/trans_closure.tmp

  distbb.conf.in:
    minor fix: pkg_src_update_summary -> pkg_update_src_summary

  Exporting LC_ALL=C and other important initializations have been
  moved from distbb.in to common.in. Now every significant
  initialization is made in PREFIX/libexec/distbb/stage_*, i.e. these
  scripts become more all-sufficient.
