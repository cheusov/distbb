Version 0.25.0, by Aleksey Cheusov

  Now bulk builds don't stop in case of connection failure to the
  build host (power down, segfault, hang up for any reason etc.). Such
  a host is marked as unavailable and distbb continuous to work
  reassigning a failed package (if any) to another build host.

  EXTRA_DEPS_CMD variable has been removed from configuration.
  Packages listed in EXTRA_DEPS are built one-by-one in order they are
  listed in.

  stage_gen_report: new link in "Jumps" section

Version 0.24.0, by Aleksey Cheusov

  distbb.conf is splitted into two parts: global defaults
  (distbb.default.conf) and user's settings (distbb.conf). This is
  major change in distbb! Instead of upgrading your existing
  distbb.conf it is *strongly* recommended to recreate it from
  examples/ template. Sorry for inconvenience.

  added: 'distbb -r|--retry' option. if your bulk build failed for
  some reason, you may continue it from that point it stopped at by
  running 'distbb -r -B YYYYMM.HHMM'

  stage_upload_pkgs now supports NO_BIN_ON_CDROM and NO_BIN_ON_FTP.
  By default all packages are uploaded. If you want to change this,
  set UPLOAD_PKGS_FILES variable in your distbb.conf
  (See distbb.default.conf for a list of available variants).

  stage_xxxx.html improvements. Packages failed due to their
  dependencies now have their own info.html. So, you can see its
  summary and decide whether to fix this package or not.

  DEPENDS_TARGET configuration variable is removed, now it should be
  a part of EXTRA_OPTS. See distbb.default.conf

  mini report is introduced (META/report_mini.txt) which is sent by
  stage_report (by default). In this mini report "Failures per
  maintainer" and "Failed due to dependencies" sections are removed.
  A purpose of this is to reduce a size of the report sent by email
  (pkgsrc-bulk mailing list has limitations).

  New config variable REPORT_MINI_SIZE_LIMIT. report_mini.txt sent by
  email is limited to approximately REPORT_MINI_SIZE_LIMIT bytes.

  PKGNAMEs are removed from report{,_mini}.txt. This also reduces
  report's size.

  New configuration variable BUILD_STAGES which stores a list of
  building stages.  If you want to, for example, send report before
  uploading binaries, change this variable in your distbb.conf.
  But be careful, list of available stages may change in the future.

  dbb_init target does not output useless noise to stdout anymore. As
  a result it is usually not listed in failed package's stage_*.html.

  Usage of REPORT_CMD changed. Now redirection from stdin (report.txt)
  should be inside it. Update your distbb.conf and set I_AM_READY to 4

  ADDED: new config variables USER_MAIL and MAIL_PROG. They are for
  stage_report.

  ADDED: PKG_CMP_SUMMARY_CMD configuration variable, for setting
  a program for comparing pkg_summary(5) for available binaries and
  pkg_src_summary collected from pkgsrc source tree.

  distbb.default.conf SPECIAL_PACKAGES:
  'dbb_canbebuild' and 'replace' targets removed, 'dbb_vars' added

  dbb_vars target fix: POSIX sed does not except \n

Version 0.23.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu,  6 Nov 2008 01:51:28 +0200

  fix: yet another PKGNAME->PKGPATHm_PKGNAME
  movement in stage_gen_report

Version 0.23.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  2 Nov 2008 17:04:29 +0200

  While running bulk builds for PKGSRC+WIP packages, I've found that
  PKGNAME is not unique for ALL packages. So, neither PKGPATH nor
  PKGNAME is unique.  This leads to distbb failure happened because
  different packages have the same directory for logging.  To avoid
  this I've changed per-package logging directory from PKGNAME to
  category_package_PKGNAME, e.g. pkgtools_pkg_chk_pkg_chk-1.2.3.

     The same may happen if you build, for example, (for testing
     purposes) both
       textproc/dictem:EMACS_TYPE=xemacs215 and
       textproc/dictem:EMACS_TYPE=xemacs214.
     In both cases PKGNAME remain the same. This case is not fixed yet.

Version 0.22.2, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 31 Oct 2008 19:38:24 +0200

  FIXED: qt3-libs and qt4-libs fail at dbb_vars stage because of '<'
  symbol inside CONFIGURE_ARGS value. NOW it is fixed.

Version 0.22.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 24 Oct 2008 11:25:43 +0300

  FIXED typo in stag_gen_report:
       packages_failed_prev_cnt(bug) -> packages_failed_deps_cnt(ok)

  Workaround for the following bug in Korn shell.
     Seen on Interix's /bin/sh, FreeBSD's /bin/sh (and NetBSD's /bin/ksh)

       0 ~>cat /home/cheusov/tmp/1.sh

  DISTBB feature list in README

Version 0.22.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 19 Oct 2008 12:04:34 +0300

  New stage_post_build containing user's actions is added.
  Actions are defined in 'post_build' shell function in distbb.conf.
  Update your existing distbb.conf! I_AM_READY=3 is required.

  distbb.mk: new 'dbb_vars' target that outputs formatted variables
  values. They may be useful for debugging.
  I put dbb_vars to the default TARGETS.

  Code updating "virtual best" bulk build directory
  is now separated to an individual stage - stage_update_best.
  It is run after 'stage_gen_report'.

  distbb.conf: logging directory default changed from xxx/log to xxx/logs.

  stage_gen_report: progress messages become more verbose 

Version 0.21.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon, 13 Oct 2008 14:04:05 +0300

  DISTBB_CONF environment variable points to the distbb configuration file,
  it is overriden by -C option (distbb -C). -C option is new option.
  By default @@sysconfdir@@/distbb.conf is used.

  distbb.conf:
     New mandatory conf variable DISTBB_LOCAL_MK, that should
     point to distbb.local.mk

  distbb_diff:
     +d means that given package is now built correctly but
     previously was failed DUE TO ITS DEPENDENCIES

     -c means "pkg_src_summary" failed for given package

     n[-+] changed to N[-+]

  REPORT

     META/packages_total.txt renamed to META/packages_built_total.txt,
     new "Packages built (total)" line added to META/report.html
     META/packages_built_total.txt = META/packages_built_{*}.txt

     New report file META/packages_failed_total.txt,
     new "Packages failed (total)" line added to META/report.html
     META/packages_failed_total.txt = META/packages_failed_{*}.txt

     New report file META/packages_failed_notavail.txt that lists
     packages marked as "not available",
     new "packages marked as not available" line added to report.{txt,html}

     New entry to the report: "Inspected packages"

     PKGNAME/stage_xxx.html: links to other stages appear both at the
     top and bottom of the html page

     If building stage succeeded without any output
     (e.g. dbb_canbebuilt or dbb_excluded) it is not listed in other
     PKGNAME/stage_xxx.html files, i.e. no links to such files

     Link to package's summary (PKGNAME/summary.txt) is added to
     PKGNAME/stage_xxx.html

Version 0.20.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Tue, 30 Sep 2008 00:58:46 +0300

  hot fix for distbb_diff (stage_gen_report might fail)

Version 0.20.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 14 Sep 2008 11:11:33 +0300

  FIX: serious bug in "stage_build is rerunable" feature.
  Generating a queue of tasks was not fully correct.

  FIX: stage_gen_report may fail because of spaces inside MAINTAINER
  field in package's summary (lang/gauche/Makefile revision 1.50).
  Now everything after comma is removed, that is only first maintainer
  in the list is printed.

  fix: META/packages_{built,failed}.txt may have duplicates when
  PREFIX/libexec/distbb/stage_build is run more than once
  (rerun manually after unexpected failure)

  New section in report.{html,txt} - "old bulk build vs. new bulk build".
  It contains a list of packages that was built previosuly but failed
  and more. See information about distbb_diff executable below.
  To activate it, run 'distbb -B'. By default this feature is disabled.

  New section in report.{html,txt} - "BEST bulk build vs. new bulk
  build".  The same as "old bulk build vs. new bulk build" but instead
  of "old bulk build", "virtual best" bulk build is used.  It is not a
  real bulk build but a collection of packages that where built
  sucessfully in the past. In this section you'll see ALL regressions,
  not only regressions in comparison with ONE PREVIOUS bulk build.

  report.txt is reorganized. Now it is aligned to 75-columns.
  No "Failed Stage" column, ---- separator between sections,
  "responsible person" is not included anymore
  and other minor changes.

  "failed due to deps" section is reorganized in both report.html and
  report.txt. Both maintainers are output, i.e. maintainer of the
  indirectly failed package and maintainer of failed dependancies.

  New executable - 'distbb_diff' intended for comparing two
  bulk builds.

     usage: distbb_diff [OPTIONS] bbdir1 bbdir2
     OPTIONS:
     -h|--help              display this help message
     -V|--version           distbb version

     bbdir1 - path to bulk build directory, e.g. ~/bulk-logs/20080915.1010
     bbdir2 - path to bulk build directory

     Output format:
     <CMP> <PKGPATH> <PKGBASE> <Version(s)>
     where CMP is a combination of the following characters
     +   - package failed in bbdir1 but succeeded in bbdir2
     -   - package was built sucessfully in bbdir1 but failed in bbdir2
     R   - package was removed or pkg_src_summary failed for it
     d   - package failed due to broken dependency

  fix in stage_gen_report: detecting a "failed stage" is more correct
  now (it takes into acount SPECIAL_PACKAGES field) and becomes clearer.

  Log files PKGNAME/failed_packages.txt have been renamed
         to PKGNAME/failed_deps.txt

  META/*.raw files are not uploaded

  report_html is run once, a whole stage_gen_report is now much faster

  example distbb.conf:
     CREATE_WRKDIR_SYMLINK=no added to EXTRA_OPTS,
     obsolete PAEXEC_BUFSIZE removed,
     -m option added to pkg_src_summary (PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY)

Version 0.19.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun, 14 Sep 2008 11:11:33 +0300

  minor addition in stage_gen_report: failed package in "Failed due to
  dependencies" section are now printed in their "short" form.

Version 0.19.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 13 Sep 2008 12:00:06 +0300

  Multivariant packages, that is packages/modules for different
  versions of Apache, Python and PHP can be built by "distbb". To
  enable this set PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY variable to
    'pkg_src_summary -m ...'
  in your distbb.conf.  Because of this new feature per-package
  logging directories are changed from PKGPATH to PKGNAME. I don't
  like this (sometimes this makes untrivial the searching for logs of
  a particular packages) but I don't see any reasonable
  alternatives. AFAIK Joerg's pbulk does the same.

  "support for multivariant packages" feature has one interesting
  side-effect. PKGPATHs passed to distbb (by -f, -p options or
  LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD variable in config file) can now be "enriched"
  with building options.
  Format for this "enriched" PKGPATH:
     category/package[:var1=value1[,var2=value2[,...]]]
  For example:
     textproc/dictem:EMACS_TYPE=xemacs214
     www/ap2-wsgi:PKG_APACHE=apache22,PYTHON_VERSION_REQD=25
  Spaces are also allowed inside "valueN", they should be encoded as
  symbol ~ (tilde).
  As a result you can build several variants of a given package
  with different options (see OPTIONS framework) by passing to distbb
  "enriched" PKGPATHs like the following
     sysutils/mc:PKG_OPTIONS.mc=-subshell~-slang~-charset,PKGNAME=mc-light-4.6.1nb4
     sysutils/mc:PKG_OPTIONS.mc=samba,PKGNAME=mc-full-4.6.1nb4
     sysutils/mc:PKG_OPTIONS.mc=-x11,PKGNAME=mc-nox11-4.6.1nb4

  Local copy of pkg_src_summary (i.e. META/pkg_src_summary.txt) is
  used for building packages and generating report. This means that
  after stage_init finished, you may change PKG_SRC_SUMMARY file (by
  another distbb bulk build, pkg_update_src_summary or whatever).

  distbb.conf.in: no need for DISTBB_LOCK variable

  stage_init.in: minor fixes (awk getline vs. end of file)

  stage_init.in: if PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD fails, its stderr is
  output to stderr too, not only to META/build_src_summary_log.txt
  (normally PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD should always exit with exit
  status 0, failure means fatal error).

  Directories for logging (REPORT1_DIR/PKGNAME) are created as soon as
  they become necessary, not all at once at the beginning...
  Code for removing the empty logging directories is moved from
  stage_gen_report to stage_build

Version 0.18.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed,  3 Sep 2008 00:25:49 +0300

  stage_build becomes rerunable. If, for example, your SLAVE hosts
  hanged up, turned off due to power lost or something similar
  happened while BUILDING stage, you can continue running bulk build
  by running PREFIX/libexec/distbb/stage_build <BUILD_ID>.
  NOTE: In case MASTER host hanged up or turned off, rerunning
  stage_build may be not fully correct because of possible data loss.

  stage_build script is fully reworked. As it was planned, tricky and
  dirty shlock/sh/awk code that processes packages graph is now
  removed from distbb. All necessary functionality is generalized and
  becomes a part of external utility "paexec" (see paexec -s option).
  As a result pkgtools/shlock is not used anymore.

  wip/netbsd-uuencode is not used anymore. PAEXEC sends unencoded data
  to distbb.

Version 0.17.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri, 25 Jul 2008 15:57:14 +0300

  ADDED: -p option. If you want to build a few packages, you
  can specify them in command line:

      distbb -p 'wip/dict-server wip/pkg_online wip/distbb'

      Actually this option was added in version 0.16.0.
      I just forgot to mention it in appropriate NEWS section.

  FIXED: packages for which pkg_src_summary (pkgsrc tree scanning) failed
      (bad PKGPATH, errors in Makefile etc.)
      appear in META/packages_built_prev.txt.

      Now such packages are collected in META/package_failed_scan.txt
      If such failures happen, report.html includes an additional line

         Packages failed (pkg_src_summary/scanning)  <COUNT>  <LOGS>

  META/packages_*.txt files now look nicer. MAINTAINER field is
  added. All fields are formatted.

  Slave hosts/chroots save the building logs locally and send them to
  the master host only after building is completed/failed. This can
  speed-up building.

  "Top offenders" -> "Failures per maintainer"
     Some developers treat the word "offender" offensive.

  Packages failed at dbb_canbebuilt (that is packages failed because
  of ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM, ONLY_FOR_PLATFORM etc.) and dbb_excluded
  (packages are excluded from bulk build by person who runs a bulk
  build) stages do not increase "failures per maintainer" counter.

     It is recommended to always include dbb_canbebuilt to TARGETS,
     otherwise counters in "Failures per maintainer" will be not fully
     correct.

  Speeds-ups for stage_gen_report

  dbb_init moved back from distbb.mk to the script "slave"

Version 0.16.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 19 Jul 2008 14:13:26 +0300

  fixed: after bulk build finished, not all empty CATEGORY/PACKAGE
  directories were removed.

  packages_built_prev.txt, packages_built.txt, packages_failed.txt,
  packages_failed_deps.txt and packages_total.txt files now contain
  both PKGPATH and PKGNAME

  META/summary_cmp.txt is generated (pkg_summary vs. pkg_src_summary
  comparison) and is included to report.html

  META/pkg_src_summary.txt is generated and is included to report.html

  Progress messages are generated in META/progress.txt.
  This file is included to report.html

  Cleaning the working directories is now optional.
    distbb.conf:
       CLEAN_TARGET=clean    # clean them! (default in example distbb.conf)
       CLEAN_TARGET=dbb_none # keep them!
    Update your distbb.conf!

  html link to itself is removed from report.html

  CATEGORY/PKG/stage_*.html log files also conform to "HTML 4.01 Strict".
  Tested via http://validator.w3.org

  An internal "init" target and initial (before building start)
  "clean" targets are not hard-coded in libexec/distbb/slave script
  anymore.  The special target "dbb_init" is implemented in
  share/distbb/distbb.mk for initialization (removing PREFIX/PKGDBDIR
  and unpacking bootstrap).  Both "dbb_init" and "clean"
  targets should be a part of TARGETS variables.  Update your local
  distbb.conf and set I_AM_READY to 2

  META/packages_built.txt is sorted alphabetically and is included to
  report.html as "list", That is, no "sorted" and unsorted" lists
  anymore.

  Minor fixes and additions in example distbb.conf

Version 0.15.1, by Aleksey Cheusov, Mon,  7 Jul 2008 18:06:24 +0300

 FIXED: another bug in handling EXTRA_DEPS

Version 0.15.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sat, 21 Jun 2008 19:59:21 +0300

  META/packages_total.txt file is built that contains a list of built
  packages plus those that are not rebuilt (no need for this). This
  file is uploaded by stage_upload_logs.

  report.html now includes links to META/packages_total.txt,
  META/packages_built_prev.txt, META/packages_built.txt,
  META/packages_failed.txt and META/packages_failed_deps.txt.

  added: option -B to 'distbb' executable. This is useful for
  debugging. It sets an unchangeable BUILD_ID.

  LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD command is run on the first slave host from
  $SLAVES list in case both SLAVES and TRANSPORT are set.  The problem
  with master host is that master's and slave's /usr/pkgsrc may be not
  the same.

Version 0.14.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Wed, 18 Jun 2008 22:14:56 +0300

  FIXED: sometimes packages are built in a wrong order.

  FIXED: there were two examples for PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD
  in the sample distbb.conf:
  'pkg_update_src_summary' and 'pkg_src_summary'. But the latter
  just didn't work because these two commands have incompatible usage.
  Now this is fixed but changes are incompatible with old distbb.conf.
  Update it according to the new sample for distbb.conf.
  Also set I_AM_READY variable to 1.
  Side effect: 'pkg_src_summary -A' can now be used for generating summary.
  This will build pkg_src_summary only for requested packages (distbb -f)
  and their dependencies, not for entire pkgsrc
  tree (pkg_update_src_summary).
  Both Hubert's bulk build and pbulk work this way. Now distbb too.

  FIX: EXTRA_DEPS now can contain more than one package and is handled
  correctly. Copy EXTRA_DEPS_CMD from the sample to your distbb.conf

  The following files are sorted alphabetically:
     CATEGORY/PACKAGE/failed_packages.txt
     CATEGORY/PACKAGE/failed_because.txt
     META/packages_built_prev.txt
     META/packages_failed_deps.txt
  In case of LOTS of failures this makes searching in these files much easier.

  Latest paexec, runawk and pkg_summary-utils are needed.

  report.html and all others conforms to HTML 4.01 Strict specification.
  Thanks to validator.w3.org
  UTF-8 charset is also used (See NOTES and RESPONSIBLE variables)

  "build_end" date/time are moved from stage_gen_report to stage_build.

  Lots of comments and suggestions in the sample for distbb.conf

  Other minor fixes, improvements and code clean-ups.

Version 0.13.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 12 Jun 2008 23:40:46 +0300

  ADDED: mega-feature/new variable SPECIAL_PACKAGES

     Example and notes from distbb.conf:
     ...
     # some packages fail to build because they are a part of pkgsrc
     # bootstrap.  if you want to build them try to uncomment lines in
     # SPECIAL_PACKAGES variables
     #
     # you may also want to use different building options
     # to build some packages, e.g. to use gcc-3.4 for building audio/festival,
     # under Linux Debian/etch or DragonFlyBSD where it is a part
     # of "base" system, see lines in SPECIAL_PACKAGES.
     # NOTE: There are no quotes around string containing spaces
     #       (this is not shell ;-) )
     # NOTE: An empty string after EACH package section is mandatory
     # NOTE: Do not forget that you can define your own Makefile targets
     #       in distbb.local.mk. this new target can run, for example,
     #       pkg_add -u

     SPECIAL_PACKAGES="\

  distbb.conf: 'extract' and 'patch' targets are in TARGETS now.

  distbb.conf: fix in comment: package-deinstall -> deinstall

Version 0.12.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  8 Jun 2008 02:49:08 +0300

  Two new variables (for distbb.conf) are introduced:
    - STDIN_FROM_DEV_NULL:
      Some broken packages need an interaction with user even if BATCH
      variable is set to YES. This may "hang" a bulk build. If you
      don't want this, set the following variable to "1", otherwise
      leave it unset.
    - LOG_SIZE_LIMIT:
      If STDIN_FROM_DEV_NULL=1, some packages may produce infinite
      garbage to stdout and in turn may waste ALL your free disk
      space. To prevent this, set the following limit. Leave it unset
      for no limit.

  fix:
     If there is nothing to be built stage_build may fail under Linux,
     Solaris, HP-UX, Interix and probably many others. This is because
     Free/NetBSD xargs works differently - in case of no input it just
     do NOT call program (xargs's argument) at all. Others do.

   stage_*.txt files are not uploaded anymore.
   Only html versions are uploaded.

   README: distbb is NOT fork of pbulk in any way! ;-)
   It was written from scratch.

Version 0.11.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 15 May 2008 18:59:18 +0300

  Both .html and .txt report include a number failed dependencies for
  each indirectly failed package. This number was limited by hard-coded
  constant, now it is regulated by variable MAX_FAILED_DEPS_CNT Add it
  to your distbb.conf.

  stage_gen_report: fix for Debian dash - its ` and $( work
  differently :-(

  distbb uses TARGETS variables that contains a list of targets to run
  in order to build, install and create a binary package. TARGETS
  variable can easily be changed by user and this makes distbb very
  flexible - user may change build order or even define his own
  build/packaging procedure. As of this version user can define
  his/her own make rules without changing mk.conf and without
  recreating bootstrap tarball - by changing
  /usr/pkg_distbb/etc/distbb.local.mk file, second configuration file
  of distbb. distbb also defines two its own special targets which you
  can use: dbb_canbebuilt and dbb_excluded.  Read comments in
  /usr/pkg_distbb/share/distbb/distbb.mk about them.  Note that
  etc/distbb/local.mk MUST exist, copy it from
  share/examples/distbb/distbb.local.mk to etc/distbb.local.mk
  and edit for preferences.

Version 0.10.0, by Aleksey Cheusov

  At startup, PREFIX and PKGDBDIR directories are deleted and
  bootstrap is unpacked (on all $SLAVES when MASTER_MODE=yes).
  NOTE: if you are upgrading from previous versions of distbb,
  recheck your EXTRACT_BOOTSTRAP_CMD (tar -C / is needed).

  distbb.conf: more examples for alternative/distributed
  PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD. If you'll use distributed one,
  make sure PATH variable contains /usr/pkg_distbb/bin directory.

Version 0.9.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Fri,  9 May 2008 13:02:30 +0300

  Instead of red counts the "Breaks" column now contains the link to
  the actual list of indirectly failed packages.

  stage_gen_report: hard-coded string "Responsible person" is not printed

  distbb.conf: another variant for PKG_UPDATE_SUMMARY_CMD

  Additions and more details in README

  BUILD_START renamed to BUILD_ID

Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  4 May 2008 20:50:43 +0300

  Sometimes building packages stops because some of them require an
  interaction with user. BATCH=yes doesn't help.  In order to prevent
  this, bmake is run with < /dev/null. As a result, such a bad
  packages can not break/stop bulk builds anymore.

  distbb version is included to the report.

  An information about the person that runs a bulk build, is
  optionally included to the report.

  LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD variable is introduced.  It defaults to
  'pkg_list_all_pkgs'.  If set, the specified command is run to get
  list of packages to be built.
  You need to upgrade your distbb.conf
     Examples:
        LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD='@@bindir@@/pkg_list_all_pkgs'
        #LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD='( @@bindir@@/pkg_list_all_pkgs
                              cat my_extra_wip_packages.txt )'

  added: distbb --version|-V options

  "on <SLAVEHOST>" is appended to 'succeeded' and 'FAILED' log
  messages. That is now it is seen on which host a particular package
  succeeded or failed.

  distbb.conf.in:
  # The following is for pkg_summary-tools > 0.5.0
  #PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD='@@bindir@@/pkg_update_src_summary -f "PKGNAME PKGPATH DEPENDS BUILD_DEPENDS"'

Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 17 Apr 2008 12:30:58 +0300

  stage_init.in: completely reimplemented. An algorithm become easier
  and cleaner. FIXED: incorrect calculating "build_previously" count,
  and therefore "total_packages" too. The code also become cleaner.

  FIX: build_init.in now doesn't depend on fields order in
  pkg_src_summary (doesn't reply on that PKGPATH is before
  [BUILD_]DEPENDS). This may cause an infinite loop because of
  incorrect (cyclic) dependencies in META/tmp/trans_closure.tmp

  distbb.conf.in:
    minor fix: pkg_src_update_summary -> pkg_update_src_summary

  Exporting LC_ALL=C and other important initializations have been
  moved from distbb.in to common.in. Now every significant
  initialization is made in PREFIX/libexec/distbb/stage_*, i.e. these
  scripts become more all-sufficient.
