Version 0.8.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Sun,  4 May 2008 20:50:43 +0300

  Sometimes building packages stops because some of them require an
  interaction with user. BATCH=yes doesn't help.  In order to prevent
  this, bmake is run with < /dev/null. As a result, such a bad
  packages can not break/stop bulk builds anymore.

  distbb version is included to the report.

  An information about the person that runs a bulk build, is
  optionally included to the report.

  LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD variable is introduced.  It defaults to
  'pkg_list_all_pkgs'.  If set, the specified command is run to get
  list of packages to be built.
  You need to upgrade your distbb.conf
     Examples:
        LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD='@@bindir@@/pkg_list_all_pkgs'
        #LIST_ALL_PKGS_CMD='( @@bindir@@/pkg_list_all_pkgs
                              cat my_extra_wip_packages.txt )'

  added: distbb --version|-V options

  "on <SLAVEHOST>" is appended to 'succeeded' and 'FAILED' log
  messages. That is now it is seen on which host a particular package
  succeeded or failed.

  distbb.conf.in:
  # The following is for pkg_summary-tools > 0.5.0
  #PKG_UPDATE_SRC_SUMMARY_CMD='@@bindir@@/pkg_update_src_summary -f "PKGNAME PKGPATH DEPENDS BUILD_DEPENDS"'

Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov, Thu, 17 Apr 2008 12:30:58 +0300

  stage_init.in: completely reimplemented. An algorithm become easier
  and cleaner. FIXED: incorrect calculating "build_previously" count,
  and therefore "total_packages" too. The code also become cleaner.

  FIX: build_init.in now doesn't depend on fields order in
  pkg_src_summary (doesn't reply on that PKGPATH is before
  [BUILD_]DEPENDS). This may cause an inifinite loop because of
  oncorrect (cyclic) dependancies in META/tmp/trans_closure.tmp

  distbb.conf.in:
    minor fix: pkg_src_update_summary -> pkg_update_src_summary

  Exporting LC_ALL=C and other important initializations have been
  moved from distbb.in to common.in. Now every significant
  initialization is made in PREFIX/libexec/distbb/stage_*, i.e. these
  scripts become more all-sufficient.
