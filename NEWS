Version 0.7.0, by Aleksey Cheusov

  stage_init.in: completely reimplemented. An algorithm become easier
  and cleaner. FIXED: incorrect calculating "build_previously" count,
  and therefore "total_packages" too. The code also become cleaner.

  FIX: build_init.in now doesn't depend on fields order in
  pkg_src_summary (doesn't reply on that PKGPATH is before
  [BUILD_]DEPENDS). This may cause an inifinite loop because of
  oncorrect (cyclic) dependancies in META/tmp/trans_closure.tmp

  distbb.conf.in:
    minor fix: pkg_src_update_summary -> pkg_update_src_summary

  Exporting LC_ALL=C and other important initializations have been
  moved from distbb.in to common.in. Now every significant
  initialization is made in PREFIX/libexec/distbb/stage_*, i.e. these
  scripts become more all-sufficient.
